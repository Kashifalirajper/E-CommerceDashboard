## Additional Q&A

- **Essential Libraries:**

  - `vue-router`: For routing and navigation within the dashboard.
  - `chart.js`: To visualize interactive charts for revenue analysis.
- **Optional Libraries:**

  - `vue-upload-component`: Might be necessary for the product image upload feature.
- **Considerations with TypeScript:** Adopting TypeScript can improve code reliability and predictability. Especially for e-commerce admin pages with many columns, TypeScript can help in type-checking and ensuring data consistency.
- **Handling Datetime:** Always store and handle datetime in UTC. Convert to the user's timezone only when displaying. JavaScript's `Date` object and libraries like `moment-timezone` can be handy for these conversions.
